Shim: Shay's Vim Colorscheme
=================================

I got sick of iTerm's slowness, and Terminal.app's lack
of decent themeness and decided to fix the problem.

This theme is heavily inspired by the Railscasts textmate theme

Install
---------------------------------

You will need the SIMBL Color plugin for Terminal.app installed

[do this](http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/11/01/customising-colours-in-leopard-terminal)

After installing you will need to load the included
terminal profile.

Then you can use this WICKED theme in all it's glory!!
