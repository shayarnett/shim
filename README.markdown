Shim: Shay's Vim Colorscheme
=================================

I got sick of iTerm's slowness, and Terminal.app's lack
of decent themeness and decided to fix the problem.

This theme is heavily inspired by the Railscasts textmate theme

Install
---------------------------------

2. Load the included Terminal.app profile.

3. Profit!!
