Shim: Shay's Vim Colorscheme
=================================

I got sick of iTerm's slowness, and Terminal.app's lack
of decent themeness and decided to fix the problem.

This theme is heavily inspired by the Railscasts textmate theme

To install you will need the SIMBL Color plugin for 
Terminal.app installed [http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/11/01/customising-colours-in-leopard-terminal](do this)

After installing you will need to load the included
terminal profile.

Then you can use this WICKED theme in all it's glory!!
